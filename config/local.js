   * Ports are a transport-layer concept designed to allow many different    *
   * networking applications run at the same time on a single computer.      *

   * The runtime "environment" of your Sails app is either typically         *
   * 'development' or 'production'.                                          *

   * In development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you       *
   * (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and               *
   * debugging output)                                                       *

   * In production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to        *
   * optimize performance. You should always put your app in production mode *
   * before you deploy it to a server.  This helps ensure that your Sails    *
   * app remains stable, performant, and scalable.                           *

   * By default, Sails sets its environment using the `NODE_ENV` environment *
   * variable.  If NODE_ENV is not set, Sails will run in the                *
   * 'development' environment.                                              *
